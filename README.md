Next.js Job Board â€“ a full-stack web app enabling job postings and notifications, secured with Auth0, leveraging MongoDB, and utilizing Resend for email delivery.

# Job Board App

A modern, full-stack job board application built with Next.js, Auth0, MongoDB, Resend for job notification emails, and Zod for schema validation.

## Overview

This repository is a showcase of my work, highlighting my skills in full-stack development, authentication, database integration, email notifications, and advanced filtering with a tag system. It is publicly available for recruiters, employers, and collaborators to review my code and technical approach.

**Live Demo:**  
The app is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and can be viewed in action at:  
[https://your-project-name.vercel.app](https://your-project-name.vercel.app)

> **Note:** Running the app locally is optional. The live deployment on Vercel is the best way to experience the app in action.

## Features
